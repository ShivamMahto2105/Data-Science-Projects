# 🧠 Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! This repository is a collection of hands-on projects where I apply various data analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques using Python and its data ecosystem.

Each project in this repository is structured with clean code, insightful analysis, and clear documentation to reflect practical applications of data science principles.
